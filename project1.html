                <p>We developed "The Adventures of Tom," an interactive assessment game aimed at <b>quantifying students' 
                    proficiency and assisting them in their learning and review process</b>. It encompasses essential features 
                    such as <b>quests, lesson delivery, a program tracker, review questions, and assessments</b> that provide quick 
                    results upon completion. The game specifically focuses on the subject of <b>Computer Programming 1</b>, covering
                     topics related to programming concepts, logic formulation, and an introduction to the Java programming 
                     language and its features.</p>

                <p>As a <b>programmer</b> for "The Adventures of Tom," a Python-based interactive assessment game for BSCS freshmen
                     students of Colegio de San Gabriel Arcangel (CDSGA), I focused on developing <b>core mechanics</b> such as 
                     <b>player movement, interactive elements, and creating a captivating game world</b>. I leveraged Python's 
                     versatility to ensure smooth navigation between different timelines using a time portal. Additionally, 
                     I contributed to <b>integrating engaging features like the main menu, quest log, and lesson log for a 
                     user-friendly experience</b>. Working with the team, we utilized various tools and technologies to enhance 
                     functionality and visual appeal, strengthening my skills in Python programming and game development.</p>
                    
                <p>We are incredibly honored and proud to announce that our thesis capstone project
                has been awarded the prestigious title of <b>'Best Thesis'</b> in our department at 
                Colegio De San Gabriel Arcangel. This recognition serves as a testament to the dedication, 
                hard work, and passion that we poured into our research and project. We would like to extend our 
                heartfelt gratitude to our advisors, mentors, and the entire faculty who supported and guided us 
                throughout this challenging journey. This award is a culmination of countless hours of research,
                analysis, and collaboration, and it motivates us to continue striving for excellence in our academic
                and professional pursuits. We are truly grateful for this recognition and look forward to contributing
                more to our field in the future.</p>
